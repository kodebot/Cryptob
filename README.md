## Price Burst
### How it works?
We try to capture the price burst to buy low and sell high.

1. Every x seconds, fetch order book and compare asks and bids (x is usually between 3 and 5)
2. Findout if price is going up - TODO: explain how it figures out the price is going up
3. If price is going up, BUY
4. Wait for profit target to reach and sell
5. If price is falling or something not working as expected then sell everything for market price
